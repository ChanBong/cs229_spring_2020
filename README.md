# CS229: Machine Learning Solutions

Here are my solutions to [Stanford's Machine Learning graduate class (CS229)](http://cs229.stanford.edu/), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

The problems sets are the ones given for the class of Fall 2017 but I followed the lectures and notes of Spring 2020 (Couldn't find psets from that semester :/).

For each problem set, solutions are provided as an iPython Notebook.
